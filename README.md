This file contains information regarding my Production Project for my Computer Science degree. TODO write a proper description.

# Installation (with source code)
Download all files, and place them in an empty directory.

Set up the list.nodes file

# Setup (list.nodes)
In the directory the program is to execute in (by default, /bin/Debug/net7.0-windows/), place an empty file called "list.nodes".
In this file, node setup works as follows:

  The first two values of a node are its X and Y coordinates.
  
  Any subsequent values of a node are other nodes that it can connect to.
  
  Node indexing starts at 1, as a default node is provided at node 0.
  
  At least one node must connect to node 0.
